## ⭐ Featured Research Project

### CGT-Hyperbolic-Embeddings

**Contrastive Geometric Transfer: 24× Sentence Embedding Compression via Hyperbolic Geometry**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Compression | 384d → 16d (24×) |
| Performance Retention | 97.1% Spearman on STS-B |
| Storage Reduction | 96% |
| Geometry | Lorentz (Hyperboloid) Model |

**What it implements:**
- Complete Lorentz manifold operations (exp/log maps, geodesics, Fréchet mean)
- CGT student-teacher framework with multi-objective loss
- **H-LLM**: Full Hyperbolic Transformer with geodesic attention
- Ψ-SLM extensions: H-NCA, H-AKOrN, topological field
- Gromov-Wasserstein structural alignment
- Falsification protocols (F1-F3) for scientific rigor

**Key Differentiators:**
- 🔬 **Original research** with 15+ peer-documented papers on Zenodo
- 📐 **Mathematically rigorous** — all operations have closed-form derivations
- 🧪 **Falsifiable** — explicit protocols to disprove claims
- 🚫 **No hype** — clear separation between implemented vs. theoretical

**Publications:** [Zenodo Collection](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18379741)

> *"This project demonstrates the intersection of geometric deep learning, representation theory, and production ML engineering."*
