## ⭐ Featured Research Projects

*"Scaling has been remarkably effective—but effectiveness does not imply exhaustiveness."*

### Hyperbolic-Intelligence

**Exploratory Research in Non-Euclidean Neural Architectures**

Research framework investigating whether hyperbolic geometry can provide a more natural substrate for hierarchical information than flat Euclidean space.

**What it implements:**
- Complete Lorentz manifold operations (exp/log maps, geodesics, Fréchet mean)
- **CGT**: Contrastive Geometric Transfer for sentence embedding compression
- **H-LLM**: Full Hyperbolic Transformer with geodesic attention
- **H-AKORN**: Kuramoto oscillatory dynamics for temporal binding
- Ψ-SLM extensions: H-NCA, topological field, Gromov-Wasserstein alignment
- Falsification protocols (F1-F3) for scientific rigor

**Publications:** [Zenodo Collection](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18379741)

---

### Geometric-Intelligence

**UGFT Simulator: Unified Geometric Field Theory Implementation**

Interactive scientific simulator demonstrating Geometric Intelligence through Hyperbolic Neural Cellular Automata (H-NCA) with H-AKORN phase dynamics.

**What it implements:**
- Real-time H-AKORN dynamics on hyperbolic tessellation
- Kuramoto order parameter with temporal evolution
- Topological analysis (Betti numbers β₀, β₁, β₂)
- Counterfactual causation testing (topological downward causation)
- WebGPU-accelerated visualization with Canvas 2D fallback

**Live Demo:** [UGFT Simulator](https://gokuhayda.github.io/geometric-intelligence/)

---

**Key Differentiators (both projects):**
- 🔬 **Original research** with 15+ peer-documented papers on Zenodo
- 📐 **Mathematically rigorous** — all operations have closed-form derivations
- 🧪 **Falsifiable** — explicit protocols to disprove claims
- 🚫 **No hype** — clear separation between implemented vs. theoretical
- 🌐 **Open exploration** — invites collaboration, not claims of superiority

> *"What if the bottleneck isn't size, but shape?"*
