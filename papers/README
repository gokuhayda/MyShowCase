This is a comprehensive README.md file designed for a GitHub repository acting as a central hub for your research papers and their associated code implementations.
It is structured to present your work as a cohesive research program (The Phenomenal Manifold Framework), categorizing the papers by their specific contributions (Theoretical, Architectural, Experimental) and clearly stating the status of the code for each.

Status: Active Research (2025–2026)
🌌 Overview
This repository contains the theoretical frameworks, mathematical proofs, and experimental code implementations for a series of papers investigating the Phenomenal Manifold Hypothesis (PMH).
This research program explores the intersection of Hyperbolic Geometry, Riemannian Optimization, Topological Data Analysis, and Oscillatory Neural Dynamics to model the structural organization of conscious experience and emergent complexity in artificial systems.

📄 Research Papers & Implementations
1. The Phenomenal Manifold Hypothesis (PMH)
Subtitle: A Geometric Framework Induced by Informational Dynamics 📅 Date: November 2025 (Revised)
 * Abstract: Proposes that conscious experience is a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold (\Psi) projected from high-dimensional neural parameter space. Defines the "Hybrid Metric" combining information geometry with three neural invariants: Integration (\mathcal{I}), Coherence (\Gamma), and Differentiation (\Delta).
 * Key Contributions: * Formal definition of the projection \pi: \mathcal{P}(M_4) \rightarrow \Psi.
   * Differential predictions vs. IIT, GNWT, and Predictive Processing.
   * Geometric interpretation of altered states (meditation, psychedelics).
 * 💻 Code Status: Coming Soon (Manifold learning pipeline & reconstruction procedures).
2. The Topological Signature of Consciousness
Subtitle: A Gromov-Wasserstein Framework for Neural-Phenomenal Alignment 📅 Date: January 2026
 * Abstract: Introduces a methodology using Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) Optimal Transport to align the metric space of neural states with the metric space of phenomenal distinctions. Uses Topological Data Analysis (Persistent Homology) to distinguish genuine structure from high-dimensional noise.
 * Key Experiment: Color Ring Toy Model — Recovering circular topology (\beta_1 = 1) from noisy neural spike trains.
 * 💻 Code Status: Available (Simulation code for Color Ring model & GW Alignment).
   * Path: /src/gw_topology
3. Lorentz-Manifold Transformers (LMT)
Subtitle: A Geometric-Dynamical Framework for Hierarchical Representation Learning 📅 Date: January 2026
 * Abstract: Addresses the "Geometric Capacity Bottleneck" in standard Transformers. Integrates Hyperbolic Geometry (Lorentz model) for exponential capacity with H-AKOrN (Hyperbolic Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons) for temporal binding.
 * Key Contributions:
   * Manifold Capacity bounds proving exponential advantage (\Omega(e^r)).
   * Geometric Frustration (\mathcal{F}) as a misalignment metric.
   * Phase-transition failure modes in structural coherence.
 * 💻 Code Status: In Progress (Synthetic validations & H-AKOrN dynamics).
   * Path: /src/lmt_model
4. The \Psi-Former
Subtitle: Topological Downward Causation via Riemannian Optimization 📅 Date: January 2026
 * Abstract: A deep learning architecture designed to explicitly instantiate PMH constraints. Features Topological Downward Causation, where the phenomenal manifold exerts causal influence on neural weights via Riemannian optimization (K-FAC).
 * Key Contributions:
   * Phenomenal Risk Score (PRS): Ethical framework for AI phenomenology.
   * Architecture: Hyperbolic Embeddings + Kuramoto Oscillators + Transformer-XL + K-FAC.
   * Scalability: Inverse-free natural gradients and mean-field approximations.
 * 💻 Code Status: In Progress (WikiText-103 training scripts & K-FAC implementation).
   * Path: /src/psi_former
5. Hyperbolic Neural Cellular Automata (H-NCA)
Subtitle: A Geometric Framework for Emergent Complexity 📅 Date: January 7, 2026
 * Abstract: Transposes Neural Cellular Automata to hyperbolic tessellations (Pentagrid \{5,4\}) to solve the temporal binding problem and capacity bottlenecks in distributed systems.
 * Key Experiment: Emergent phase synchronization and geometric structure preservation in 61-cell hyperbolic grids.
 * 💻 Code Status: Available (Pentagrid setup & H-AKOrN dynamics).
   * Path: /src/hyperbolic_nca
